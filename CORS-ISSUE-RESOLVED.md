# CORS Issue - Final Resolution

## The Real Problem
The CORS fix we implemented **was actually working correctly**! The issue was that the verification script found `localhost:8000` in the built files, but this was coming from a **test/debug page** that had a hardcoded URL, not from the main application code.

## What Happened
1. The main API service (`src/lib/services/api.js`) was correctly using `PUBLIC_API_URL`
2. But `/test-upload` page had a hardcoded `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/upload/` on line 34
3. This hardcoded URL was being included in the production build
4. The verification script detected this and reported failure

## The Fix
Changed the test-upload page from:
```javascript
const directResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/v1/upload/', {
```
to:
```javascript
const directResponse = await fetch(`${api.API_BASE}/upload/`, {
```

Now it uses the same API base URL as the rest of the application.

## Current Status
- ✅ Main application API calls use production URL
- ✅ Environment variable injection is working correctly
- ✅ Test pages now also use the correct API URL
- ✅ No more hardcoded localhost references

## Deployment
1. Commit this final fix
2. Run deployment: `./deployment/deploy-mvp.sh`

The CORS errors should now be completely resolved!
