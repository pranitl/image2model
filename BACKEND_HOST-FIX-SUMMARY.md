# BACKEND_HOST Environment Variable Fix

## The Problem
The frontend was making API calls to a malformed URL:
```
https://image2model.pranitlab.com/api/v1BACKEND_HOST=backend/upload/
```

## Root Cause
The deployment script was appending `BACKEND_HOST=backend` to the `.env` file without ensuring a newline existed at the end of the file. This caused the variables to concatenate:

```
PUBLIC_API_URL=https://image2model.pranitlab.com/api/v1BACKEND_HOST=backend
```

Instead of:
```
PUBLIC_API_URL=https://image2model.pranitlab.com/api/v1
BACKEND_HOST=backend
```

## The Fix

### 1. Fixed the Server Environment File
Corrected the malformed line in `/opt/image2model/.env` by adding the missing newline.

### 2. Updated the Deployment Script
Modified `deployment/deploy-mvp.sh` to check for and add a newline before appending variables:

```bash
# Ensure file ends with newline before appending
[ -n "$(tail -c 1 .env)" ] && echo >> .env
```

### 3. Rebuilt the Frontend Container
Ran a fresh build with the corrected environment variable to ensure the proper API URL is embedded in the JavaScript bundles.

## Result
The frontend now correctly uses `https://image2model.pranitlab.com/api/v1` for all API calls, resolving the CORS errors.

## Prevention
Always ensure environment files end with a newline when appending values, especially in automated scripts.
