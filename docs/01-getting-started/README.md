## 🎯 Key Concepts

**image2model**: An AI-powered web application that transforms 2D images into 3D models using advanced generative AI technology.

**Batch Processing**: The capability to process up to 25 images simultaneously, optimizing workflow efficiency for bulk conversions.

**Face Limit**: A configuration parameter that controls the complexity and detail level of generated 3D models, affecting polygon count and file size.

**Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Real-time communication protocol used to stream processing progress updates from server to client.

**GLB Format**: Binary version of the glTF (GL Transmission Format) 2.0 file format that includes textures, making it ideal for 3D model distribution.

## 🚀 Getting Started Path

### For Developers

1. **Start with Quick Start** - Get running in 5 minutes with our [Quick Start Guide](./quick-start.md)
2. **Understand the Architecture** - Review [Architecture Overview](./architecture-overview.md) for system design
3. **Read the PRD** - Understand business requirements in the [Product Requirements](./3d-image-mvp-prd.md)
4. **Choose Your Path**:
   - Frontend? Head to [Frontend Documentation](../02-frontend/)
   - Backend? Check out [Backend Documentation](../03-backend/)
   - DevOps? Visit [Deployment Guide](../04-deployment/) (coming soon)

### For AI Agents

- Start with the [Architecture Overview](./architecture-overview.md) to understand system interactions
- Review component-specific documentation in frontend/backend sections
- Check [API Reference](../03-backend/api-reference/) for endpoint details (coming soon)

## 📊 Project Status

### Current State (MVP)

- ✅ Core upload/process/download flow
- ✅ Real-time progress updates
- ✅ Batch processing support
- ✅ Basic error handling

### Planned Features

- 🔄 User authentication
- 🔄 Job history
- 🔄 Cloud storage integration
- 🔄 Advanced model parameters
- 🔄 3D preview in browser

## 🔗 Key Resources

### Internal Documentation

- [Frontend Architecture](../02-frontend/architecture/) (coming soon)
- [Backend API Reference](../03-backend/api-reference/) (coming soon)
- [Deployment Guide](../04-deployment/) (coming soon)

### External Resources

- [FAL.AI Documentation](https://fal.ai/models/tripo3d/tripo/v2.5/image-to-3d/api)
- [Project Repository](https://github.com/your-org/image2model)

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Get the basic flow working before adding features
2. **Test Often**: Use the test images in `tests/fixtures/`
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check both frontend console and backend logs
4. **Handle Errors**: Always implement proper error handling

### Common Gotchas

- API keys must be configured in `.env`
- File size limits are enforced (10MB per file)
- SSE connections require proper CORS configuration
- Redis and PostgreSQL must be running for the application to work

## 🤝 Getting Help

- Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](../07-reference/troubleshooting/common-errors.md) (coming soon)
- Review the [FAQ](../07-reference/troubleshooting/faq.md) (coming soon)
- Search existing documentation
- Open an issue if you find bugs
