# Celery Queue Configuration - Issue Resolution

## Summary

Successfully resolved GitHub Issue #2: "Celery worker not processing tasks - missing queue configuration"

## Problem Resolved

- **Issue**: Celery worker only listening to `default` queue, ignoring custom queues
- **Impact**: Tasks stuck in PENDING state indefinitely in queues: model_generation, batch_processing, maintenance, priority
- **User Experience**: Indefinite "queued" status for 3D model generation jobs

## Solution Implemented

### Files Modified:

1. **docker-compose.yml** (Line 104)
   - Added queue specification: `-Q default,batch_processing,model_generation,maintenance,priority`

2. **docker-compose.prod.yml** (Multiple lines)
   - Fixed celery app path: `app.core.celery_app` (was incorrectly `app.workers.celery_app`)
   - Added queue specification to all worker services
   - Configured specialized workers for different queue types

## Validation Results

✅ **Worker Configuration Verified:**
- All 5 queues now active: default, batch_processing, model_generation, maintenance, priority
- Tasks being received and processed from all custom queues
- No more stuck PENDING tasks

✅ **Live Testing Confirmed:**
- Health check tasks (priority queue): SUCCESS
- 3D model generation tasks (model_generation queue): PROCESSED
- Maintenance tasks (maintenance queue): PROCESSED

## Impact

- **Immediate**: All background tasks now process correctly
- **User Experience**: No more indefinite "queued" status
- **System Performance**: Proper task distribution and priority handling
- **Reliability**: Maintenance and cleanup tasks now execute as scheduled
