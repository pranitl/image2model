# 500 Error Diagnosis Report

## Executive Summary
After thorough investigation by three independent agents, we've determined that the 500 error is **NOT** caused by missing API keys or environment configuration issues. All required environment variables are properly configured and passed to the Docker containers.

## Investigation Results

### ✅ Environment Configuration (Initially Suspected)
- API_KEY is properly set in .env.production
- ADMIN_API_KEY is properly set
- FAL_API_KEY has a valid API key
- All environment variables are correctly passed to Docker containers via docker-compose.prod.yml

### ❌ Missing Import Bug
- Found but not the cause of this 500 error
- Affects a different endpoint (/api/v1/upload/image)
- Has exception handling that prevents 500 errors

### ⚠️ Database Issues
- Tables don't exist but the app doesn't use them currently
- All operations use filesystem + Redis only

## New Hypothesis: Deployment State Issue

Since the environment is correctly configured, the 500 error might be caused by:

1. **Stale Container State**: The backend container might be running with old environment variables
2. **Container Not Restarted**: After fixing the BACKEND_HOST issue, the backend might not have been fully restarted
3. **Nginx/Backend Communication**: There might be an issue with how nginx forwards requests to the backend

## Recommended Actions

### 1. Force Container Restart with Fresh Build
```bash
ssh root@66.228.60.251
cd /opt/image2model
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.production down
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.production build --no-cache backend
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.production up -d
```

### 2. Check Backend Logs
```bash
docker logs image2model-backend --tail 100
```

### 3. Verify Environment Inside Container
```bash
docker exec image2model-backend env | grep -E "(API_KEY|FAL_API_KEY)"
```

### 4. Test Direct Backend Access
```bash
# From inside the server
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/upload/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY_VALUE>" \
  -F "files=@test.txt"
```

## Most Likely Root Cause
The backend container is running with stale environment variables from before the fixes were applied. A full restart with the correct environment file should resolve the issue.

## Next Steps
1. Execute the force restart commands above
2. Check the backend logs for the actual error message
3. If the error persists, the logs will reveal the true cause
