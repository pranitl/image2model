   - Updated SSE event handling for named events
   - Fixed endpoint URLs to match backend
   - Maintained backward compatibility

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Critical Issues (Fixed)
1. **API Compatibility**

### Minor Issues (Identified)
1. **Cancel Functionality**
   - Cancel endpoint not available in API
   - Client-side cancellation only

2. **File Preview Generation**
   - Consider adding loading states for thumbnails
   - Could optimize for large batches

## Test Files Created

1. `test-checklist.md` - Comprehensive testing checklist
2. `test-validation.html` - File validation test suite
3. `test-errors.html` - Error handling test suite
4. `test-responsive.html` - Responsive design tester
5. `test-sse.html` - SSE reconnection test suite

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Add loading states for all async operations
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Add retry mechanisms for failed uploads
4. Improve form validation feedback

### Medium Priority
1. Add tooltips for complex features
2. Implement breadcrumb navigation
3. Add help/documentation links
4. Optimize thumbnail generation

### Low Priority
1. Add animation polish
2. Implement dark mode support
3. Add keyboard shortcuts
4. Add progress persistence
